/**

 *
 * The value of this property reflects the number of ranging events which reported the beacon in the `CLProximityUnknown` state required to reset its attributes. By default this is 1, which means a single ranging event is enough to reset the beacon's attributes - resulting in immediate refreshes of all the `CLProximityUnknown` beacons. If you set it to e.g. 3, then 3 consecutive ranging events reporting the beacon as `CLProximityUnknown` are required to drop its last known attributes.
