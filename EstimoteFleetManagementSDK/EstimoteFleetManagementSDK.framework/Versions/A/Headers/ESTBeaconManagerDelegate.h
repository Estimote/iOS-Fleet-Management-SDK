 * This method is called whenever the application's ability to use location services changes. Changes can occur because the user allowed or denied the use of location services for your application or for the system as a whole.

 * If the authorization status is already known when you call the `requestWhenInUseAuthorization` or `requestAlwaysAuthorization` method, the beacon manager does not report the current authorization status to this method. The beacon manager only reports changes to the authorization status. For example, it calls this method when the status changes from `kCLAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined` to `kCLAuthorizationStatusAuthorizedWhenInUse`.
