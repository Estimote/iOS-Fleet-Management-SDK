*  Eddystone-URLDomain based filter used by `ESTEddystoneManager` in discovery process.
*  Filter should be initialized with URL Domain string that is matching device(s)
*  should be discovered. URL domain gives more flexibility then regular URL based filter.
*  It allows to scan family of devices sharing same url domain in broadcasted packet.
*
*  For example you can have two devices broadcasting http://go.esti.be/kitchen and
*  http://go.esti.be/bedroom urls. In that case scanning with URL Domain defined as 'go.esti.be'
*  will provided both devices as discovery process result.
