## 4.29.0 (Apirl 4, 2019)

### Renaming!
Starting with version 4.29.0 this SDK will be named `Estimote FleetManagement SDK`, but don't worry - no API changes!
We've updated the name of the SDK to better reflect its purpose.
## 4.28.0 (March 21, 2019)

Features:
- Added "TemperatureOffset" setting.

  You can use this setting to calibrate the beacon's temperature sensor.

  For example, if you measure that the sensor in the beacon is off by 1.2 degree C (shows 21.2 instead of 20.0), set the temperature offset to -1.2.

## 4.27.0 (December 18, 2017)

Features:
-  Some classes have new initializers with queue for dispatching events of a `CBCentralManager`, see: `ESTDeviceManager`, `ESTMeshManager`.
- `ESTDeviceManager` has a new delegate method returning error for device discovery failure (see: `- (void)deviceManager:(ESTDeviceManager *)manager didFailDiscoveryWithError:(NSError *)error;`. Previous callback is deprecated since 4.27.0).

## 4.26.3 (November 13, 2017)

Bugfixes:
- Fixed not connecting with Location Beacons.

## 4.26.2 (November 10, 2017)

Features:

Improvements:
- Simplified `ESTMeshManager` documentation, so it should be easier to grasp Mesh related concepts.
- Better granulation of asking for permissions when using Estimote Monitoring.

Bugfixes:
- Simplified and cleared confirming Mesh Buffer during connecting with Location Beacon,
- Confirming commands when connecting with Location Beacon,
- Minor cleaning and code improvements.

## 4.26.1 (October 24, 2017)

Bugfixes:
- Fix for `ESTBeaconDevice` crash when using `ESTBulkUpdater` update functionality.
- Fix for broken save of name, tags and location in Estimote Cloud using operation based mechanism.

## 4.26.0 (October 23, 2017)

- Mesh network's settings can be set through `ESTMeshManager`
- connecting with Location Beacon confirms applying commands to Mesh network

Bugfixes:
- geolocation setting synchronises properly with Cloud
- incorrect comparing firmware revisions during the OTA update process

## 4.25.4 (October 16, 2017)
